        <h2>How to Identify a Bird</h2>

        <p>When encountering an unfamiliar species, look for these traits to get the most information about its possible identity. Remember - color isn't everything!</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Shape and silhouette. Usually, these traits are fairly consistent within an order or family, but this kind of high-level identification can still be helpful, especially if you don't know where to start looking!</li>
            <li>Size. Try comparing it to other birds near it, or to environmental props you know the size of.</li>
            <li>Posture. Does it hold its body at an angle, or more horizontally? Is its tail held up or stuck straight out?</li>
            <li>Movement, on land and in the air. Does it walk on the ground, or hop? If you see it in flight, watch and see if it ever pulls its wings in and drops for a moment - or, conversely, if it ever stops flapping and glides.</li>
            <li>If the bird is in the air, take note of the edges of its wings and tail. Do you see "notches" between the feathers?</li>
        </ol>
